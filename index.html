        <p> The University of Michigan's Football team just had its first undefeated regular season since 1997. On December 3rd, we beat Purdue University to be crowned Big 10 Champtions. Next up for the Wolverines is the College Football Playoff. 
            
        The Committee decided we were deserving of the #2 seed. Therefore, we will be playing TCU in the Fiesta Bowl in the Semifinals. If we win this game, we will face off against the winner of Georgia, the team who knocked us out of the playoff last year, and Ohio State, our bitter rival who we beat earlier this season. LETS GO BLUE!</p>
